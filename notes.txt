Notes from Typescript course
Core Types:

Number --> 1, 2.3, -6, etc... - no differentiation between integers or floats
string --> 'hi', `hi`, "hi" - all text values 
boolean --> true/false - just these two - no 'truthy' or "falsy"

The key difference is: Javascript uses 'dynamic types' (resolved at runtime), Typescript uses 'static types' (set during development).
--> Typescript only provides this support during development
